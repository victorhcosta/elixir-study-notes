# Elixir Study Notes

## Original

This repository contains code examples written in Elixir during my studies.

My intention is to concentrate examples of implementations here while I study Elixir. In some cases, I may separate the code into another repository, for example, a repo with an application using Phoenix or Sugar. In such cases, I will reference the repo in the [Projects](./SUMMARY.md#projects) section.

To see implementations, you can go to the notebooks folder or in the [Notes](./SUMMARY.md#notebooks) section to search by some specific example. And to see what material I used to study, you can refer to the [resources section](./SUMMARY.md#resources).
I will also save livebook notebooks with summaries of my study notes and examples.
