Currently, I'm studying using the playlist on Stone's YouTube channel and the Elixir documentation.

[Alquimia Stone - Formação Gratuita em Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv3nyCBtlWP8I9rknIrfcJWrO05yEzknD)

I'm also considering to use the playlists:

[From Zero to Hero in Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaY7qWIrmqtFoZLvOvYRZG5hl367UybRp) from LittleAlchemist.io
[Intro to Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJbE2Yu2zumA-p21bEQB6nsYABAO-HtF2) from  Tensor Programming
