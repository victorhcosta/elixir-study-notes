# Hi
I'm Victor Costa, a front-end developer studying Elixir, and I will put here courses that I use to learn Elixir language or related themes (frameworks, best practices, etc.)

## What I'm currently using to study?
The elixirschool website and the Elixir documentation, when I start another course I update here.

## Courses that maybe I study in the future:
* [From Zero to Hero in Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaY7qWIrmqtFoZLvOvYRZG5hl367UybRp) from LittleAlchemist.io
* [Intro to Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJbE2Yu2zumA-p21bEQB6nsYABAO-HtF2) from  Tensor Programming

## Finished courses:
* [Alquimia Stone - Formação Gratuita em Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv3nyCBtlWP8I9rknIrfcJWrO05yEzknD)
